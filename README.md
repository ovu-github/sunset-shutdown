# sunset-shutdown
Shuts down my pc when the sun goes down, to better align to the body with the circadian rhythm

## How to run:

- Run the python file or the jupyter notebook
- It will prompt you to enter your country and city name,   
  based on that it will scrape the sunrise and sunset from the web
